# GameOffJam
Repository for itch.io game off 2018 

> **DISCLAIMER:** This project is in development and may not be finalized, so it will contain bugs and incomplete things. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## IDEA
The idea is very simple: create a game to manage a city (like CitiesSkylines), but without any map.

Why? Well, I want to focus on the management of the city as such, not on how beautiful it is.
